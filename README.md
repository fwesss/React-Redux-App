# HMDA Explorer

An interactive map displaying statistics derived from single family lending data made avaliable by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.

The goal of this project was to show affordability in different counties and how it affected homebuying patterns. I calculated 2 ratios, the median homebuyer income to loan amount, and median resident income to loan amount.

My hypothesis going into this project was that lack of affordabilty not only blocks residents from purchasing, but also encourages over-leveraging. I believed there may be a threshold where the median resident was not entirely blocked out, but would need to stretch their income further than those in other counties would be comfortable with.

The map showed that there were counties where the income to average loan amount ratio for the median homebuyer was much higher than other counties, but also higher than the median residents' income in their own counties.

Unfortunately, the CFPB deprecetated the public API I used access HMDA data so statistics are no longer displayed.
